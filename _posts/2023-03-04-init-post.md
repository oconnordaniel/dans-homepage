# initial post

This is the fist page post. Followed the guide from [Techno Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q) to build this site. Then push this site into a doocker file, also from on of [Techno Tim's guides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnSH8Ht3MIc).

## What did I do?

1. Build Jekyll

    Step one is to install ruby, then use gem to install jekyll and bundler.

    On Ubuntu

    ``` bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev git
    ```

    On MacOS

    ``` bash
    brew install chruby ruby-install xz
    ```

    Install bundler

    ``` bash
    gem install jekyll bundler
    cd project-file
    bundle
    ```

2. Modify jekyll config

    Next we need to modify the config file.

    ``` yaml
    timezone: America/Denver
    title: Dans-Homepage
    description: >- 
        Dans site for sharing the things I build (and break)
    ```

    And update all the social links.
    Also make sure to update the `_data/contact.yml` file with what contact sites I want. Remove Twitter and rss, add Mostodon and LinkedIn.

3. Add pages

    Next step will be to add pages. This is done by adding a `YYYY-MD-DD-name.md` to the `_posts/` folder.

    This file also needs a header at the top 

    ``` yaml
    ---
    title: dans-site init
    date: 2023-03-04 10:00:00 -700
    catagories: [meta,setup]
    tags: [meta,setup]
    ---
    ```

    Then the rest of the file is filled with the markdown for the post.

4. Build for prod

    Next step is to view and build the site.

    Use `bundle exec jekyll s` to build the site localy. This will build the site then host it locally on port `4000`. Once we like how it looks, we can complie the whole site to html for publishing to the web.

    ``` bash
    JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll b
    ```

    Adding the `JEKYLL_ENV=production` put all the needed html pages in the `_site` folder. From there it's ready to be hosted.

5. Docker build with

    Once it's in that folder, we can push all the files into a docker image. Dockerfile is silly simple. Nginx apline stable.

    ``` Dockerfile
    FROM nginx:stable-alpine
    COPY ./_site /usr/share/nginx/html
    ```

    Then just build and run it.

    ``` bash
    docker build . -t dans-homepage
    docker run -d -p 80:80 dans-homepage
    ```

6. Push dockerfile to AWS?

    While this site works now, next step is to push it to a cloud site somewhere. Probably AWS or Linode.

    ``` bash
    aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 597070230033.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com

    docker build -t dans-homepage-repo . #already done

    docker tag dans-homepage-repo:latest 597070230033.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dans-homepage-repo:latest

    docker push 597070230033.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dans-homepage-repo:latest
    ```
